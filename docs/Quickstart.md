# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with OLLM CLI in 5 minutes! This guide will walk you through your first conversation with the AI.

---

## Before You Start

Make sure you've [installed OLLM CLI](Installation.md). You should have:

- ✅ OLLM CLI installed (`ollm --version` works)
- ✅ Ollama running (`ollama list` shows models)
- ✅ At least one model downloaded

If not, go back to the [Installation Guide](Installation.md).

---

## Your First Conversation

### 1. Start OLLM CLI

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
ollm
```

You'll see the OLLM CLI interface:

```

│ Welcome to OLLM CLI!                                            │
│                                                                  │
│ Type your message and press Return to chat.                    │
│ Press Ctrl+K for commands, Ctrl+? for help.                    │
│                                                                  │
│ > _                                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ● Ready | Ctrl+K: Commands | Ctrl+P: Panel | Ctrl+?: Help     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Say Hello

Type a message and press `Return`:

```
You: Hello! What can you help me with?
```

The AI will respond:

```
Assistant: Hello! I'm here to help you with a variety of tasks:

- Writing and debugging code
- Answering questions about programming
- Searching the web for information
- Reading and editing files in your workspace
- Running commands and automating tasks
- And much more!

What would you like to work on today?
```

### 3. Ask a Question

Try asking something:

```
You: What's the difference between let and const in JavaScript?
```

```
Assistant: Great question! Here's the key difference:

**let:**
- Creates a variable that can be reassigned
- Block-scoped (only exists within its { } block)
- Example: let count = 0; count = 1; // ✓ Works

**const:**
- Creates a variable that cannot be reassigned
- Also block-scoped
- Must be initialized when declared
- Example: const name = "Alice"; name = "Bob"; // ✗ Error

However, const doesn't make objects immutable:
const user = { name: "Alice" };
user.name = "Bob"; // ✓ Works (modifying property)
user = {}; // ✗ Error (reassigning variable)

Use const by default, and only use let when you need to reassign.
```

## Using Tools

The AI can use tools to help you. Let's try some:

### Reading Files

```
You: Read the package.json file
```

```
Assistant: [Uses read_file tool]

I can see your package.json file. Here's what I found:

{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  }
}

You're using React 18.2.0 and TypeScript 5.0. Would you like me to
check if there are newer versions available?
```

### Searching the Web

```
You: Search for the latest React version
```

```
Assistant: [Uses web_search tool]

According to my search, React 19 was released in December 2024.
The latest stable version is 19.0.0.

Key new features in React 19:
- Actions for handling form submissions
- New 'use' hook for reading promises
- Improved error handling
- Better server components support

Would you like help upgrading your project to React 19?
```

### Running Commands

```
You: Run npm test
```

```
Assistant: [Uses shell tool]

Running tests...

> my-project@1.0.0 test
> vitest run

✓ src/utils.test.ts (5 tests) 234ms
✓ src/components/Button.test.tsx (3 tests) 156ms

Test Files  2 passed (2)
     Tests  8 passed (8)
  Start at  14:32:45
  Duration  1.2s

All tests passed! ✓
```

## Common Tasks

### Get Help with Code

```
You: I'm getting an error: "Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
```

```
Assistant: This error means you're trying to use .map() on something
that's undefined. Common causes:

1. Data hasn't loaded yet
2. API request failed
3. Variable not initialized

Can you show me the code where this error occurs?
```

### Debug an Issue

```
You: Read the login.ts file and help me debug why login isn't working
```

```
Assistant: [Reads file]

I found a potential issue on line 23. You're not handling the case
where the API returns an error. Here's the fix:

[Shows code with fix]

Would you like me to apply this fix?
```

### Learn Something New

```
You: Explain how promises work in JavaScript with examples
```

```
Assistant: Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations...

[Detailed explanation with code examples]

Would you like me to show you how to use async/await, which makes
promises easier to work with?
```

### Automate a Task

```
You: Run the tests, and if they pass, commit the changes with message "Fix login bug"
```

```
Assistant: [Runs tests]
All tests passed!

[Runs git commands]
Changes committed with message "Fix login bug"

Done! Your changes are committed and ready to push.
```

## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific

❌ **Vague:** "Fix my code"  
✅ **Specific:** "Fix the login function in auth.ts - it's not handling errors correctly"

### Provide Context

❌ **No context:** "How do I do this?"  
✅ **With context:** "I'm building a React app. How do I fetch data from an API and display it?"

### Break Down Complex Tasks

❌ **Too complex:** "Build a complete authentication system"  
✅ **Step by step:** "First, create a login form component. Then we'll add the API integration."

### Use Tools

❌ **Describe files:** "My package.json has React 18"  
✅ **Let AI read:** "Read package.json and check the React version"
