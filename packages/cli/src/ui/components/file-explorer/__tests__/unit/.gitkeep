# Unit Tests Directory

This directory contains unit tests for individual File Explorer components and services.

Unit tests focus on:
- Specific examples of file operations
- Edge cases (empty directories, single-file trees)
- Error conditions (invalid paths, permission errors)
- Integration points between components
- UI rendering with specific inputs
