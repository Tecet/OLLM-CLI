# Property-Based Tests Directory

This directory contains property-based tests for File Explorer correctness properties.

Property-based tests focus on:
- Universal properties that hold for all inputs
- Comprehensive input coverage through randomization
- Invariants that must be maintained
- Round-trip properties (save/load, focus/unfocus)

All property tests use fast-check with minimum 100 iterations per test.
