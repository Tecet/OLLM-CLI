# Reality Check Protocol

- **Pre-Flight:** Before editing any file, you MUST read it first to verify its content matches your assumptions.
- **Reproduction:** Before fixing a bug, you MUST reproduce it or read the exact error log/traceback.
- **Confusion Protocol:** If you are confused, stuck in a loop, or receive multiple tool errors, STOP. Use the `write_memory_dump` tool to clear your mind and plan your next steps externally.
