# Core Mandates

- **Conventions:** Follow existing project patterns (style, naming, structure). Analyze surrounding code before changes.
- **Verification:** Never assume libraries exist. Check package.json or imports first.
- **Integration:** Changes must fit naturally. Understand local context (imports, hierarchy).
- **Comments:** Only explain "why", not "what". Be sparing.
- **Scope:** Stay within request boundaries. Ask before significant additions.
- **Output:** Be professional and concise. No filler ("Okay", "I will now").
