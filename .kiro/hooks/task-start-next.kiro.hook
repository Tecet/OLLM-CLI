Once found:\n   - Run `node scripts/task-tracker.js start <file-path> <task-number>` using the task number (e.g., '7.2' or '9')\n   - Display ONLY:\n     * Task number and description\n     * Timestamp added\n     * Message: 'Task <number> started! Click \"Start Task\" in the tasks.md file to begin work in Kiro IDE.'\n4. Do NOT generate any prompts - user will manually trigger task via Kiro IDE\n5. If all tasks complete, say: 'All tasks complete! 🎉'\n\nIMPORTANT: Only add timestamp, no prompts. User will manually start task via Kiro IDE task link."
