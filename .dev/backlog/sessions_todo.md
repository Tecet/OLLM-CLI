## Codebase Audit Findings

### 1. Session System (chatRecordingService.ts)

**Current State:**
- ✅ Service exists and functional
- ✅ Auto-save enabled by default
- ✅ Session cache implemented
- ✅ File storage at ~/.ollm/sessions/
- ⚠️ **ISSUE:** Empty session files reported (Task 7 in works_todo.md)

**Files:**
- `packages/core/src/services/chatRecordingService.ts` - Main service
- `packages/core/src/services/types.ts` - Session types
- `packages/core/src/core/chatClient.ts` - Integration point
- `packages/core/src/services/__tests__/chatRecordingService.test.ts` - Tests

**Potential Issues:**
1. Session ID mismatch between creation and recording
2. Auto-save not triggering correctly
3. File write failing silently
4. Cache not flushing to disk

### 2. Snapshot System (snapshotManager.ts)

**Current State:**

## Remaining Work (Prioritized)

### Phase 0: Input Preprocessing & Goal Extraction (CRITICAL) 🔥🔥🔥
**Priority:** HIGHEST | **Effort:** 2-3 days | **Status:** ⏳ Not Started

**Goal:** Extract signal from noise, clarify intent, set proactive goals BEFORE conversation starts

**The Problem:**
- Users send long messages with typos, logs, garbage, buried intent
- LLM reads everything, gets confused, responds to noise
- Context fills with garbage (3000 tokens of rambling)
- Compression compresses garbage along with signal
- No clear direction or milestones

**The Solution:**
1. **Detect long messages** (>500 tokens)
2. **Extract intent** - LLM reads, extracts key points, fixes typos
3. **Clarify with user** - "I understand you want to: [intent]. Correct?"
4. **Propose goal** - "Goal: [goal]. Milestones: 1) 2) 3). Proceed?"
5. **Create intent snapshot** - Capture user intent for future reference
6. **Store clean signal** - Only extracted intent in active context
7. **Store original** - Full message in session file (for RAG/memory)
8. **LLM becomes proactive** - Tracks milestones, suggests next steps

**Architecture:**

```
User Message (3000 tokens, typos, logs, garbage)
  ↓
[TRIGGER: >500 tokens]
  ↓
InputPreprocessor.extractIntent()
  ├─ Fix typos
  ├─ Extract key points
  ├─ Identify attachments (logs, code)
  └─ Generate clean intent (1 sentence)
  ↓
[CLARIFICATION LOOP]
LLM: "I understand you want to: [intent]. Key points: 1) 2) 3). Correct?"
User: "Yes" / "No, actually..."
  ↓
[GOAL PROPOSAL]
LLM: "Goal: [goal]. Milestones: 1) 2) 3). Shall I proceed?"
User: "Yes"
  ↓
[INTENT SNAPSHOT CREATED]
Snapshot captures:
  ├─ Original message (full)
  ├─ Extracted intent (clean)
  ├─ Key points
  ├─ Proposed goal
  ├─ Milestones
  └─ Timestamp
  ↓
[STORAGE]
Active Context: Extracted intent (100 tokens) ✅
Session File: Original message (3000 tokens) ✅
Intent Snapshot: Complete extraction ✅
  ↓
[PROACTIVE MODE]
LLM tracks milestones:
  ✅ Milestone 1: Analyze logs
  ⏳ Milestone 2: Identify root cause
  ⏳ Milestone 3: Implement fix
```

**Example Flow:**

**User sends:**
```
hey so i was thinking like we need to uhh you know fix that thing 
with the auth system because users are complaining and also there's 
this bug where sometimes it crashes and i saw in the logs [paste 
2000 lines of logs] and also we should probably add some tests 
but i'm not sure how to do that and also maybe we should refactor 
the whole thing but i don't know...
```

**LLM extracts:**
```
🤔 Let me clarify what you want:

Intent: Fix authentication system crash and add test coverage

Key points:
  1. Users reporting auth system issues
  2. System crashes (logs provided)
  3. Need test coverage
  4. Consider refactoring

Attachments:
  - Crash logs (2000 lines extracted)

Is this correct? (y/n)
```

**User:** "Yes"

**LLM proposes:**
```
🎯 Proposed Goal: Fix and test authentication system

Milestones:
  1. Analyze crash logs to identify error patterns
  2. Identify root cause of crashes
  3. Implement fix for auth system
  4. Add comprehensive test coverage
  5. Verify fix with user testing

Shall I proceed with this plan? (y/n)
```

**User:** "Yes"

**Intent Snapshot Created:**
```json
{
  "id": "intent-snapshot-abc123",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-27T12:00:00Z",
  "original": "[3000 tokens of rambling]",
  "extracted": {

    ],
    "typosFixed": 47,
    "attachments": [
      {
        "type": "logs",
        "content": "[extracted relevant log lines]",
        "originalSize": 2000,
        "extractedSize": 150
      }
    ]
  },
  "goal": {
    "description": "Fix and test authentication system",
    "milestones": [
      "Analyze crash logs to identify error patterns",

      "Implement fix for auth system",
      "Add comprehensive test coverage",
      "Verify fix with user testing"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Stored in Active Context:**
```
User: "Fix authentication system crash and add test coverage"
[100 tokens instead of 3000]
```

**Stored in Session File:**
```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": "[original 3000 tokens]",
  "metadata": {
    "preprocessed": true,

### Phase 3: Emergency Safety Triggers (HIGH) 🔥
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** 2-3 days | **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Implemented in Phase 1)

**Goal:** Graceful degradation when context limits approached

**Tasks:**
- ✅ Implement warning at 70% (informational)
- ✅ Implement checkpoint trigger at 80% (normal compression)
- ✅ Implement emergency compression at 95% (aggressive)
  - ✅ Triggers compress() method
  - ✅ Recalculates budget after compression
  - ✅ Validates compression was sufficient
- ✅ Implement emergency rollover at 100% (last resort)
  - ✅ Create final snapshot
  - ✅ Keep only: System prompt + Last 10 user messages
  - ✅ Ultra-compact summary (400 tokens)
  - ✅ Clear all checkpoints
  - ✅ Emit emergency-rollover event
- ✅ Add user warning messages for each level
- ✅ All tests passing (470/470)

**Implementation:**
All emergency safety triggers were implemented as part of Phase 1's `validateAndBuildPrompt()` method in `contextManager.ts`. The method checks usage percentage and triggers appropriate actions:

```typescript
if (usagePercentage >= 100) {
  // EMERGENCY ROLLOVER
} else if (usagePercentage >= 95) {
  // EMERGENCY COMPRESSION
} else if (usagePercentage >= 80) {
  // NORMAL COMPRESSION TRIGGER
} else if (usagePercentage >= 70) {
  // INFORMATIONAL WARNING
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/core/src/context/contextManager.ts` - validateAndBuildPrompt() method (Phase 1)
- `packages/core/src/context/__tests__/validateAndBuildPrompt.test.ts` - Tests (Phase 1)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Warning at 70%
- ✅ Checkpoint at 80%
- ✅ Emergency compression at 95%
- ✅ Emergency rollover at 100%
- ✅ Clear user messages at each level
- ✅ All tests passing (470/470)

**Completed:** January 27, 2026 (as part of Phase 1)

**Note:** Phase 3 was implemented ahead of schedule as part of Phase 1's pre-send validation system. The emergency triggers are an integral part of the validation logic.

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Pre-send validation** - Critical for preventing overflow
2. **Session storage** - Data loss if broken
3. **Emergency rollover** - Last resort, must work

### Medium Risk
1. **Blocking mechanism** - Could freeze UI if buggy
2. **Checkpoint aging** - Could degrade quality if wrong
3. **Snapshot system** - Confusion between two systems

### Low Risk
1. **UI enhancements** - Cosmetic, can be iterated
2. **Metrics tracking** - Nice to have, not critical
